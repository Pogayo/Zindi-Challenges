## About
I have started participationg in [Zindi](https://zindi.africa) challenges to improve my data science skills. This repository will contain notebooks of my attempts at the challenges.

1. Expresso Churn Prediction Hackathon- (Classification)
2. Basic Rights Mental Health Challenge (NLP, Multiclass Classification)
3. Tanzania Tourism Prediction Challenge by Nairobi WiMLDS (Regression)

### 1. Expresso Churn Prediction Hackathon  
Part of UmojaHack Africa series of hackathons. Was in a team (Aztech) with Kevin Sebineza and Kolotioloma Soro. Was postion 4 out of 29 on the Final Private Leaderboard. Won the third prize, according to the rules a university can only win once, CMU had 2 teams ahead of us.

### 3. Kenya Hack - Tanzania Tourism Prediction Challenge by Nairobi Women In Machine Learning Data Science
Challenge to predict how much a tourist is going to spend in Tanzania. The dataset was really small in size (~4000 rows) so it was prone to overfitting. Used XGBoostRegressor and created new features. Used mean encodings to encode categorical variables.

Was position two in the final leaderboard. 
####Takeaways
1. How to deal with overfitting
2. Different types of target encoding and the concept of smoothing.
3. Hyperparameters for Tree and ensemble models
4. When the dataset is really small and the margins are small, submit as many solutions as you can. You never know which one will win.
